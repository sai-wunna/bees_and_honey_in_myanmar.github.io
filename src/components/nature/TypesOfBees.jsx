            <h6>Asia Honey Bees</h6>
            <div>
              The Asian honey bee (AHB), Apis cerana, is found throughout the
              tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate zones of Southeast and
              mainland Asia. It is smaller and has less hair than the European
              honey bee, with pronounced black/brown and yellow stripes.

            <h6>Giant Honey Bees</h6>
            <div>
              Apis dorsata, the rock bee or giant honey bee, is a honey bee of
              South and Southeast Asia. They are typically around 17â€“20 mm long
              and build nests in exposed places far off the ground, like on tree
              limbs, under cliff overhangs, and under buildings.

              The dwarf honey bee, Apis florea, is one of two species of small,
              wild honey bees of southern and southeastern Asia. It has a much
              wider distribution than its sister species, Apis andreniformis.

            <h6>Carpenter Bees</h6>
            <div>
              Carpenter bees are species in the genus Xylocopa of the subfamily
              Xylocopinae. The common name "carpenter bee" derives from their
              nesting behavior; nearly all species burrow into hard plant
              material such as dead wood or bamboo.
